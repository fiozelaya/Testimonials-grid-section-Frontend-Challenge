## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

By completing this challenge, I managed to enforce the things I am starting to learn about HTML and CSS. 

There is one thing I'd like to highlight about the process. 

This snippet right here is something extremely important and interesting that I learned. The HTML "reset". This reset is very useful to style our document despite of the browser we are using.
```css
html{
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

*, *:before, *::after{
    box-sizing: inherit;
}
```

### Continued development

In future projects I would like to learn more about the CSS reset and which ones are better. I'd also like to look further into web responsiveness, which is something extremely important!

Lastly, I'd like to work more with JS and master HTML and CSS, as well as improving my skills in general and learn about frameworks like node.js, react.js, bootstrap, etc.


### Useful resources

- [freeCodeCamp.com](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zJSY8tbf_ys) - This youtube channel helped me getting started on my web development journey! Thanks to this course I learned pretty much everything about the basic stuff I need to start coding in JS, HTML, and CSS.
- [DevDocs](https://devdocs.io/css/) - This is an amazing site that helped me find the CSS properties I needed for this particular solution.
