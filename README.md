## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- First mobile workflow

### What I learned

The main goal for this challenge was to learn more about web responsiveness and how to do it! 

The following code snippet is how I managed to layout the site depending on the device. In this case, I used a first mobile workflow, which means I first focus on how the site is going to look on a mobile device, and then, on a desktop. Therefore, I used a media query to indicate that when the minimun width of the site is 500px, the containers' styles are going to change to make it optimal if the site is being viewed on a deskopt. 
```css
@media (min-width: 500px){
  ...
}
```
The complete code can be checked in the css file "styles" for more details about how I approached this.

### Continued development

Due to the fact that I'm just starting out, I'm well aware that there are so many things that could be better! So, in future projects I want to dig deeper into Flex and CSS grids, as well as improving my skills to approach future challenges in a better and more optimal way.


### Useful resources
